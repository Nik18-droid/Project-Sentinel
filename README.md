##  Overview

Project Sentinel is a comprehensive, AI-augmented customer churn analysis platform that transforms traditional manual analysis (2+ hours) into conversational, real-time insights (6 mins). Built to demonstrate modern Business Analyst capabilities, this project combines traditional analytical rigor (SQL, Power BI) with emerging AI technologies (Python, OpenAI API) to solve a critical SaaS business problem.

**What makes this different:** Most BA portfolios show disconnected SQL queries and static dashboards. Project Sentinel delivers a complete, integrated platform where stakeholders can explore churn data through natural conversation with an AI assistant named "Stuart."

---

##  The Problem

### Business Context

Traditional customer churn analysis faces three critical challenges:

1. **Time-Intensive**: Manual analysis takes 2-3 hours per cycle (SQL queries → Excel charts → PowerPoint → stakeholder email)
2. **Static Insights**: Reports are outdated by the time they arrive; follow-up questions restart the entire cycle
3. **Non-Scalable**: Analysis frequency limited by analyst availability; can't scale without hiring

### Business Impact

For a mid-sized SaaS company (ProjectFlow) with 5,000 customers:
- **8.5% churn rate** (425 customers churning annually)
- **₹20.6 lakhs monthly recurring revenue at risk**
- **₹2.47 crores annual revenue exposure**
- Executive team lacks real-time visibility into churn patterns

---

##  The Solution

### Project Sentinel: 5-Component Architecture

Project Sentinel reimagines churn analysis as an AI-augmented, self-service platform:

**1. Data Foundation** - Professional-quality synthetic dataset (5,000 customers with realistic churn patterns)  
**2. SQL Analysis Engine** - 10 analytical queries answering specific business questions  
**3. Power BI Dashboard** - 3-page interactive visualization for executives and analysts  
**4. AI Insights Engine (Stuart)** - Conversational interface enabling natural language exploration  
**5. Business Documentation** - Complete technical and business documentation for presentations

### Value Delivered

◆ **95% time reduction** (2 hours → 6 mins per analysis)  
◆ **Real-time insights** enabling faster intervention  
◆ **Democratized access** for non-technical stakeholders  
◆ **₹7.7 lakhs projected annual savings** from improved retention

## Usage

### Example Queries for Stuart

**Basic Analytics:**
```
"What's the overall churn rate?"
"How much revenue is at risk?"
"How many customers do we have?"
```

**Comparative Analysis:**
```
"Compare monthly vs annual contract churn"
"What's the difference between complete and incomplete onboarding?"
"Show me engagement score impact on churn"
```

**Risk Identification:**
```
"Show me the 10 highest-risk customers"
"Which customers should we focus on?"
"Who is most likely to churn?"
```

**Strategic Questions:**
```
"Why are customers churning?"
"What should we do about this?"
"What are the main churn drivers?"
```

### Stuart's Response Types

**Conversational Answer:**
```
User: "Why are customers churning?"

Stuart: "Looking at the data, monthly contracts are your biggest risk 
factor - they churn at 15.2% compared to just 4.6% for annual contracts. 
That's a 3.3x difference. The incomplete onboarding group is also 
concerning, with churn rates 2.5x higher than those who completed 
onboarding. Combined, these two factors account for about ₹15.2 lakhs 
of the ₹20.6 lakhs total revenue at risk."
```

**Data Table Display:**
```
User: "Show me high-risk customers"

Stuart: "Here are the top 10 customers most likely to churn, 
sorted by risk score and revenue impact:"

[Displays interactive table with customer_id, contract_type, 
pricing_tier, monthly_revenue, risk_score]
```

## Stuart’s Analytical Intelligence: Real-World Examples

Stuart goes beyond static data queries. It performs structured business reasoning, explains its assumptions, and stays within logical boundaries. Through prompt engineering in app.py, it recognizes analytical, strategic, and hypothetical contexts—and adjusts its responses accordingly.

Here are real project examples demonstrating Stuart’s intelligence and reliability:

**Q1. Logical Boundaries: The “What If” Scenario**

This test highlights Stuart’s ability to reason about hypothetical outcomes without fabricating unsupported numbers.

Question: “What’s the financial impact of improving our onboarding completion rate from 60 to 80 percent?”

Result: Stuart used the known incomplete-onboarding churn rate (15.5 percent) to infer potential improvement while referencing the existing “Revenue at Risk”             value (₹ 2,055,553 per month). Rather than hallucinating an arbitrary forecast, it described the analytical path a human would take—reducing churn,               estimating retained revenue, and connecting onboarding to financial health.

What this shows: Stuart performs controlled predictive reasoning. It knows how far to go with available data, framing logical insights instead of fake                             precision—proof of business-grade reliability.

**Q2. Stress-Testing: Handling Ambiguous Data (CLV Analysis)**

This test evaluates Stuart’s discipline when confronted with missing metrics.

Question: “If we add a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) column, how would you calculate it? Show me examples for CUST_00045 and CUST_00220.”

Result: Stuart outlined the CLV formula (CL = Average Revenue / Churn Rate) and clearly explained its variables. When asked to compute the number, it                     recognized the dataset lacked historical purchase data and refused to guess, instead requesting more input.

What this shows: Stuart doesn’t hallucinate or invent unavailable data. It remains analytical and grounded, reinforcing trust for decision-making environments.

**Q3. Strategic Prioritization: Focused Churn Intervention**

This test demonstrates Stuart’s ability to transform raw insight into an actionable strategy.

Question: “If I could only implement one intervention to reduce churn, which should it be and what’s the expected revenue impact?”

Result: Stuart pinpointed Incomplete Onboarding Churn (15.5 percent) as the highest-impact category and quantified its link to revenue at risk (₹ 2 million monthly). It proposed improving onboarding completion as the single most effective intervention to drive retention and revenue lift.

What this shows: Stuart functions like a strategic analyst. It prioritizes high-leverage actions, connects churn metrics to financial outcomes, and communicates decisions with business clarity.
